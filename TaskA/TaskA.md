## Challenges of detecting the exploit

1. Flash Loans Complexity : flash loans allows users to borrow without collateral provided they are repaid in the same text. Detecting malicious loans is difficult due to complexity of its implementation and cuz attackers mimic legitimate arbitrage strategies.

2. AMM Manipulation: manipulating the price within an Automated Market Maker (AMM) by changing the liquidity distribution across ticks. Since its happens over shorter timeframes, complicating detection through conventional price monitoring.

3. Cross Protocol arbitrage: exploit price differences across multiple Protocols. Tracking is expensive due to data Enginering as there is no standard for data formats

4. High Tx Vol: monitoring every tx in real time and analyzing it is very computationally & infra expensive.

5. Onchain data limitations : onchain privacy soln and ofchain components and offchain oracles hinder detection

6. Sophisticated Attacks :
